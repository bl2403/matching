        <p>
            In this part of the experiment, you will be asked to provide advice to students of other preference
            types. You will be given the advice receiver's preference over the schools and asked to give suggested
            ranking and verbal reasoning to support your advice. Please in mind that these preference types are
            hypothetical; in other words, they may or may not actually exist in the experiment. You will be given
            preferences different from that of yours, so please note that when you give advice to a particular type
            of subject, you must put yourself in their position to give advice. Do not simply repeat what you did in
            the experiment. Consider what you would have done if you were of that particular preference type.
            Finally, your payoff from advice giving is 1/2 of the payoff of the subject who receives your advice. If
            multiple subjects receive your advice, your payoff will be determined by randomly selecting one from such
            subjects.
