    <h3>
        Instructions
    </h3>

        <p>
            Your are participating in an experiment that models students' school choice under a particular matching
        algorithm. You are in a group with 4 other subjects. There are three schools in total: Schools A, B, and C.
        Schools A and B each accept 2 students, whereas school A can only accept 1 student.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will be given a preference over these schools: if you are matched with your first choice in the paying
        round, then you will receive 24 ECU (Experimental Currency Unit), which can be converted to U.S. Dollars at
        the ratio of 1:0.8. Similarly, if you are matched with your second or third most preferred schools in the
        paying round, then you will receive 16 ECU or 8 ECU, respectively. For example, if your preference is given
        as School A over B over C, and you are matched with School B in the paying round, then you will receive 16
        ECU as the payoff from being matched to your second favorite school. You will participate in the school
        matching problem twice, and the paying round is randomly selected from the two rounds you participate in
        school matching. Therefore, you should participate in both rounds according to the best of your ability.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to your preferences over schools, the schools also assign ``priority rights" to certain students.
        Suppose a school gives priority right to a student, then the school will accept that student over any
        students without priority right from that school.
        </p>

        <p>
            To participate in school matching, you will be asked to submit a ranking of the three schools during the
        experiment. Notice that the ranking you submit does not need to be your true preference, though it could be.
        In other words, you are free to submit the ranking of School B, A, C even if your true preference is, say,
        School A, B, C.
        </p>

        <p>
            After collecting school ranking submissions from all 5 subjects in your group, an algorithm, called the
        Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA), will be run to determine the final matching between the students and
        schools. DAA works in the following manner:
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 1) The computer will randomly generate a ranking of all subjects which will later serve as the single
        tie-breaker, if necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 1) The computer will randomly generate a ranking of all subjects which will later serve as the single
        tie-breaker, if necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 2) The computer gathers all the rankings submitted by the subjects and then takes each subject's
            first ranked choice and make an application for him or her to that school.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 3) For each school, if the number of applicants is less than or equal to the available number of
            seats in the school, all applicants will be temporarily matched to that school. Otherwise, the
            school will temporarily accept subjects by using their priority rankings from the highest to
            lowest until all seats are taken. If two applicants have the same priority ranking, then the tie-breaker
            will be used and the subjects with higher tie-breaking number will be admitted first. Low priority
            applicants or low tie-breaking applicants in excess of the number of seats will be left unmatched
            temporarily.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 4) If at the end of the first round all subjects are matched to schools, the temporary assignment
            outcome will be finalized and the mechanism terminates. If there are any unmatched subjects, a second
            round starts where all unmatched subjects are sent to their second ranked schools.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 5) For each school that receive new applicants, the computer compares the number of its remaining
            seats with that of new applicants. If the remaining seats are more than the number of new applicants, all
            new applicants are temporarily matched to that school. Otherwise, these new applicants will be pooled
            together with the subjects who are currently matched to that school from the previous round. Among these
            new applicants and matched applicants, the school will temporarily accept applicants again by using their
            priority ranking and tie-breaking ranking from the highest to the lowest until all available seats in the
            school are exhausted. Note, it is possible that a subject was temporarily matched to the school in the
            previous round but is left unmatched in this round, because his priority or tie-breaking lottery is not
            high enough and he gets replaced by a new applicant with higher priority or tie-breaking number.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 6) At the end of the second round, if all subjects are matched with a school, then the temporary
            matching outcome will be finalized and the mechanism is terminated. However, if there are still unmatched
            subjects, then a third round will start where all unmatched subjects are sent to their next ranked school.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Step 7) This process is repeated until all subjects are matched with a school. Then the temporary
            matching outcome finalizes and the matching mechanism terminates.
        </p>

        <p>
            The detail of the DAA mechanism along with the rest of the instruction will still be available to you
            throughout the experiment.
        </p>

         <p>
            As mentioned before, you will participate in school matching twice by submitting a ranking of the three
            schools. After submitting your first ranking and before participating in school matching again, with the
            same preference over schools and priority rights, with the same group of students under the same matching
            mechanism, you have the option to receive advice from three sources:
        </p>

        <p>
            Second, own-type inter-generational advice. Such advice is given by the subject of the same preference
            type as you in the previous session. For example, if you are a type 1 subject, then the own-type
            inter-generational advice is provided by the type 1 subject who participated in the session right before
            you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, other-type inter-generational advice. Such advice is given by subjects of a different preference
            type from you in the previous session. Because there are four subjects who differ from you, the computer
            will randomly choose advice from one particular type with equal probability. For example, if you are a
            type 1 subject, then the other-type inter-generational advice will be randomly selected with equal
            probability from type 2 to type 5's advice to a type 1 subject. Note that though advice-givers may be of
            a different type from you, they are asked to put themselves in your position when giving you advice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having known these three advice sources, you will then have the option to accept advice or to reject all
            types of advice. If you reject advice-receiving, you will receive no advice for the second round of
            school matching. Should you choose to receive advice, you will then answer a couple questions: Should you
            receive 1 (or 2) pieces(s) of advice, which advice source(s) would you prefer? Based on your answer to
            these two questions, the computer will randomly select, with equal probability, the number of advice and
            the advice sources for you. For example, suppose you choose to receive advice and you prefer own-type
            advice should you receive 1 source of advice and own-type advice and other-type advice should you receive
            2 sources of advice. Then the computer would randomly choose the number of advice you receive, say 2.
            Then you will receive one piece of own-type advice and one piece of other-type advice from the previous
            session, because you answered that if you were to receive two pieces of advice, you would prefer own-type
            advice and other-type advice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Advice is costly: it costs you 1 ECU, no matter how many pieces of advice you receive. Remember, your
            final payoff from school matching is randomly selected from the first and second round, which gives you
            at least 8 ECU (if you are matched to your third preferred school in the paying round). In addition to
            your payoff from the game, you will later be asked to give advice, through which you can increase your
            payoff even more. We estimate that on average subjects will gain about 25 ECU, which is equivalent to 20
            U.S. dollars. Obviously, if you reject advice, you do not pay the 1 ECU for advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before participating in the second round, you will first read the advice assigned to you according to
            your valuation of advice in the previous stage. You will have three minutes to read through the advice.
            The detail of the mechanism and the advice you receive will still be available to you while you rank the
            schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the last part of the experiment, you will be asked to provide advice to several students who will
            participate in the school choice problem after you. The recipients of your advice may or may not be of
            the same preference type as you. Please keep in mind that these preference types are hypothetical; in
            other words, they may or may not actually exist in the experiment. Please note that when you give advice
            to a particular type of student, you must put yourself in their position to give advice. Consider what
            you would have done if you were of that particular preference type. Finally, your payoff from advice
            giving is 1/2 of the payoff of the subject who receives your advice. If multiple subjects receive your
            advice, your payoff will be determined by randomly selecting one from such subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before leaving the lab, there will be a questionnaire and two decision-making tasks. The questionnaire
            will ask you for your age, gender, grade, and major. All the information you enter will remain anonymous
            and completely confidential. It will be used for no other purpose than this experiment. After filling out
            the questionnaire, you will be asked to choose your more preferred option from the ten pairs of
            lotteries. A lottery is in the following form: you may have probability p of receiving m dollars and
            probability 1-p of receiving n dollars. The second decision task contains four questions commonly
            used in economics experiments. You should answer them according to the best of your ability.
